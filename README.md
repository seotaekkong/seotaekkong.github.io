## **Local Development**

To set up and run this website locally on your machine:

### **Prerequisites**

*   **Ruby:** Ensure you have Ruby installed (version 2.7.0 or higher recommended).
*   **Bundler:** Install Bundler gem: `gem install bundler`
*   **Jekyll:** Bundler will handle Jekyll installation via the `Gemfile`.

### **Setup**
1.  **Run the Jekyll server:**
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    This will start the local server, usually accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.

### **Customization**

*   All content is primarily managed in the `_data/` folder (`data.yml`, `research.yml`, `service.yml`) and `_pages/` folder.
*   Custom CSS is in `assets/css/custom-cv.css`.
*   JavaScript for collapsible sections is in `_includes/scripts.html`.
