        # - headline: Developed a Predictive Model for Customer Satisfaction Assessment
        - headline: Predicting Customer Satisfaction
          description: Understanding customer satisfaction is difficult because feedback is scarce. I developed an ensemble of machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction based on behavioral signals, which can be used to enhance downstream systems including product ranking and behavior modeling. 
          # Addressed a critical data sparsity problem by creating a model to infer user satisfaction from behavioral signals. The resulting score provides a foundational feature to enhance downstream systems, including product ranking and behavior modeling.
