## Work Experience

**Applied Scientist Intern**  
*Amazon (Product Quality & Perfect Order Experience)*, Seattle, WA  
*May 2024 - Aug 2024*
*   Spearheaded an initiative to solve a critical data sparsity problem, developing a predictive satisfaction model from the ground up that expanded metric coverage from <5% to 100%.
*   Owned the full project lifecycle, from problem formulation and data acquisition to building the final ensemble model (GBDTs & NN) using behavioral signals.
*   The resulting satisfaction score was validated as a powerful feature, and its integration into production systems was greenlit for development.

**Applied Scientist Intern**  
*Amazon (Search Relevance)*, Palo Alto, CA  
*May 2023 - Feb 2024*
*   Designed a novel LLM tailored for semantic search ranking, which outperformed a highly-optimized production baseline with a ~1.2% relative lift in nDCG@1.
*   Formulated a listwise ranking method for LLMs, enabling the model to evaluate the relevance of multiple products for an input query.
*   Architected a scalable data pipeline on AWS to train LLMs on a massive corpus.

**Advanced Research Team Lead and Researcher**  
*VUNO Inc.*  
*May 2019 - Aug 2022*
*   Led research on novel ML methods, resulting in first-author NeurIPS and AAAI publications.
*   Promoted to Research Lead, setting the technical direction for the advanced research team and mentoring junior members.
*   Contributed to the development and analysis of deep learning models across medical imaging modalities (Chest X-ray, CT, histopathology).

**Cryptography Developer Intern**  
*ICTK Holdings*  
*June 2017 - Aug 2017*
*   Developed a lightweight Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) library from scratch in C and Assembly, optimizing for low-latency and minimal memory usage on embedded systems.
